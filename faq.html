<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<br>
<h3>Why am I seeing "Get a browser that was made past the year 1997"?</h3>
<p style="width: 60%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">If you're seeing this error, it means JavaScript is not enabled on your browser. BLS requires JavaScript to function. To fix this, go into your browser's settings, search "javascript", click enable, and then refresh the page.<br><br>If it's already enabled, refresh the page. If this still doesn't work, BLS may be blacklisted from using javascript. To fix this, click the button to the left of the website's URL, then click "site settings". Then, scroll down to JavaScript, click the dropdown box, and then click "allow".<br><br>If JavaScript still doesn't work, or you can't find these options, your browser may not support JavaScript at all. In this case, please try a different browser.</p>

<h3>Why has all my save data dissapeared?</h3>
<p>Your save data can be deleted if you delete your browser's cache. Unfortunately, there is no way to recover this lost data. If you recently switched browsers, you can try and transfer the data between your old browser and new browser.</p>
